### Hey there!! 👋

I'm from Uttarakhand (India), also known as "Land of the Gods". I've more than 3 years of professional experience in IT sector and developing Softwares for different multi national clients. A Big fan of JAVA!

With my professional career, I'm also passionate about Music. I always enjoy staying at home and producing some good music! I'm not much of an outdoor person. I love rainy days where I can wrap myself in a blanket and binge-watch series without feeling guilty! I speak Hindi, English and obviously JAVA ;-P.
